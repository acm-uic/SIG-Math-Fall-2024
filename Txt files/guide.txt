**In C++**

Functions for Program:
- Extract function to read the input and call the operation functions below
- AND, OR, NOT, XdOR, (for later: NOR, NAND), implications
    - Have converter (EX: && -> ^) for str 
    - Parser function to read all variables and operators
    - Could use binary operations
- Menu function in main (while loop)
- Instruction function in main (printed once)
- Display Table Function 
    - Use a 2d vector (Matrix) for the table

Rules for Syntax:
AND: a&b = a^b
OR: a|b = avb
NOT: !a
Exclusive OR: axb
CONDITIONAL RIGHT: a>b
CONDITIONAL LEFT: a<b
BICONDITIONAL: a=b

Test cases for input: 
- Unfinished expression ( a^ )
- Multiple operators (^v)
- Operator DNE
- No input
- Check for invalid variables 
- Could use isalpha() 
- Should be case insensitive
